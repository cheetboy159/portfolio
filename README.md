# Portfolio

## Description 

In this assignment, we created our first portfolio page. One of the most challenging criteria's for this assignment was to make sure that it is a responsive site, meaning that the site will adapt to screen size. Through a whole bunch of trial and error, and a lot of research as well as looking over course work I can finally say I have reached a satisfying point in order for me to submit it.
